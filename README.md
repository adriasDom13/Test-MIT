Look for – The proper organization of work is a process of identifying the work to be performed, defining responsibility and authority, and also to establish relationships for the purpose of enabling people to work most effectively together to accomplish the objectives. The interdependence of the main production factors which are labor resources, work items, and human work has a conclusive impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the whole production system. This is mainly important when used in the production of multi-station work, where the human work and workstation must be adapted in a suitable way. (Grzelczak, 2018). According to Klimek and Łebkowski, Proper organization is vital for human work to be effective. It consists in setting the workflow so that maximum results can be obtained with the least amount of work and technical means. Poorly organized work leads to unnecessary consumption of production means and human work.

Change to - In order to enable individuals to collaborate most productively to achieve the goals, the process of defining responsibility and authority, as well as establishing relationships, is known as the right organization of work. The interconnectedness of the three primary production factors—labor resources, work products, and human labor—has a significant impact on the whole production system's efficiency and effectiveness. This is crucial when producing multi-station work since it requires that the human work and workstation be adjusted appropriately. (2018) Grzelczak. Klimek and ebkowski claim that effective human work requires proper structure. It entails adjusting the workflow to get the best results possible with the least amount of effort.

29.
Look for – The allocation of employees to workplaces is an important optimization issue, which consists in delegating employees to individual positions or tasks, in such a way that the cost of task completion is minimal or the total efficiency of all employees is maximal. The allocation should take into account the employee's characteristics, work efficiency, skills, experience, etc. The criterion for assessing such an assignment is, for example, achieving maximum personnel performance or filling all jobs taking into account the employees' qualifications and skills.
Change to - An important optimization problem is the assignment of workers to specific positions or tasks so that the cost of task completion is as low as possible or that the combined efficiency of all workers is maximized. The assignment must take into account the employee's traits, productivity at work, talents, experience, etc. Achieving the highest level of employee performance or filling every position while taking into account the employees' credentials and talents are two examples of criteria for evaluating such an assignment.

30.
Look for - Digitalization receives increased attention since the term “Industry 4.0” was introduced in the year 2011 which described as the vision of a digitalized industry. Thus, it labels the aim of a development which started already years before. Since digitalization in industry affects integrated processes, products, as well as business models, it is labeled as digital transformation. In result, manifold expectations came up simultaneously and led to very different and partially far reaching visions of the further development of production industry and their resulting future. The digitalization’s impact on industry became subject of the national and international scientific discussion. For recognizing development tendencies, obtaining further knowledge on the digitalization’s development and illustrating future expectations on selected studies on the vision of digitalized industry will be analyzed.
Change to - Since the term "Industry 4.0" was coined in 2011, which articulated the idea of a digitalized industry, digitalization has drawn more attention. Thus, it identifies the purpose of a process that began years before. Digital transformation is the term used to describe how digitalization affects integrated processes, products, and business models in industry. As a result, many expectations surfaced at once, giving rise to quite divergent and occasionally far-reaching ideas of the future of the production industry. The effects of digitalization on industry have been the focus of national and worldwide scientific debate. For the purpose of identifying trends in development, it is necessary to understand how digitization has evolved as well as to illustrate what the future holds for this sector of the economy.

32.
Look for - According to Furnham, Eracleou, and Chamorro-Premuzic (2009), job satisfaction is described as how far the employees are satisfied with their work. This matter often happens in which two concepts are discussed together, since it is said that an individual is contented in the work-place as there is a factor and condition that motivate people. Robbins (2006) disclose that job satisfaction is a common behavior to work performance while there are awards and achievements appropriately. Also, he defined organizational commitment as a stage in which the employee recognizes a certain group with the goals, and hopes to maintain the status. Job satisfaction has a relationship with work performance. An organization with more satisfied employees or workers tends to be more effective and productive.
Change to - How satisfied employees are with their work, according to Furnham, Eracleou, and Chamorro-Premuzic (2009), is a measure of job satisfaction. Since it is said that a person is content at their place of employment because there are certain conditions and factors that motivate people, this issue frequently involves the discussion of two concepts at the same time. According to Robbins (2006), maintaining workplace pleasure while receiving rewards and recognition for accomplishments is a frequent behavior to work performance. Additionally, he described organizational commitment as the phase in which an employee acknowledges a certain group with the objectives and aspires to uphold the status. Performance in work is correlated with job satisfaction. An organization is more likely to be successful and productive if its staff are happier.

33.
Look for - Performance is a stage of achievement of accomplishing certain work. It means that work performance is an achievement stage as a work accomplishment by an individual from the organization. It is affected by three main factors which are the organizational support, abilities or management effectiveness, and work performance of every individual working at the organization. Employee will remain if work assigned is justifiable and satisfactory. Over utilizing people won't help them perform better which is why knowing the capacity of your workforce is important and that is where this study is trying to solve.
Change to - Performance is a stage in the process of completing a task. It implies that a person's job performance is a stage in their career as an organization's employee. The three key aspects that have an impact on it are the organizational support, managerial effectiveness, and the work output of each employee. Employee will continue working if the tasks given are acceptable and justified. Knowing the capacity of your workforce is crucial since it will prevent you from overworking your employees, which is the problem that this study is attempting to address.

34.
Look for – Over the last decades, research on Human Resource Management (HRM) has focused on examining the process of the effects of HR practices on employee performance. The AMO Model helps to analyze the contribution of the employees within the organization which also has been used in recent decades as a framework to guide firms in their HR practices. It suggests that there are three independent work system components that shape employee characteristics and contribute to the success of the organization. Also, the AMO theory has been adopted extensively to potentially explain the relationship between how people are managed and subsequent performance outcomes. The AMO Model has a huge contribution to the employee performance for it analyzes the variables that determines the performance of the employees. Its origin lie in the industrial psychology perspective, which proposed that performance was a function of the abilities of employees to perform. These practices may also increase employee motivation by providing them with an opportunity to develop their professional career in the field.  
Change to – Human resource management (HRM) research has recently concentrated on examining the process of how HR practices affect employee performance. The AMO Model, which has recently been adopted as a framework to direct businesses in their HR operations, aids in analyzing the contribution of the people inside the organization. It implies that there are three separate elements of the work system that influence employee traits and help the business succeed. The AMO theory has also been widely used to possibly explain the connection between personnel management practices and subsequent performance outcomes. The AMO Model significantly affects employee performance since it examines the factors that affect employees' performance. Its

35.
Look for – The experience of employees, work environment, coworkers, managers, and other variables all interact to affect performance. Employers that want to enhance their performance should perform detailed assessments that can help to uncover problems as well as solutions within the organization. Firms have realized that they have to flourish unique dynamic characteristics that empower their competitive advantages in order to survive in a constantly changing market environment. Thus, they are focusing on the exploitation of their human resources, particularly on employee performance as a source of strategic advantage. Many researchers claim that management support is an important condition for employees’ improvement. As Morrison and Phelps (1999) also indicate, when employees perceive that the management supports their job-related efforts, then it is likely that improved job performance will be noticed. Further, Parker et al. (2006) found that management support is positively related to commitment and proactivity (employee-related factors).
Change to - Performance is influenced by a variety of factors, including the experience of the employees, the workplace, the coworkers, the supervisors, and other factors. Employers who wish to improve performance should do thorough analyses that can assist identify issues and potential solutions within the company. Businesses have come to the realization that in order to thrive in a market environment that is always changing, they need distinctive dynamic features that strengthen their competitive advantages. As a result, they are concentrating on utilizing their human resources, especially employee performance as a source of competitive advantage. According to many academics, managerial assistance is a crucial prerequisite for employees' improvement. According to Morrison and Phelps (1999), employees are more likely to do well on the job when they believe that management is supportive of their efforts.
